### <span style="color:#f05454">Sartre's notion of the project </span><a name="first"></a>

In *Search for a Method*, Jean-Paul Sartre reflects on his assigned readings on Marx, Hegel, Aristotle, etc. at the University of Paris during the 1920s,

> I found everything perfectly clear, and I really understood absolutely nothing. To understand is to change, to go beyond oneself. This reading did not change me. By contrast, what did begin to change me was the **reality** of Marxism, the heavy presence on my horizon of the masses of workers, an enormous, sombre body which *lived* Marxism, which practiced it, and which at a distance exercised an irresistible attraction on petit bourgeois intellectuals.

The first time I read this passage it struck me as a particularly powerful expression of the conception of philosophy as a fundamentally practical activity (reminiscent of both Marx and Lenin), but what I found even more striking was Sartre's appeal to the process of "going beyond oneself". This kind of subjectivity in motion turns out to be a crucial element of Sartre's existential psychology, and later in *Method* he elaborates on the idea, formalizing and expanding upon it in the notion of *the project.* 

Asserting the need for a philosophy of revolutionary action, Marx famously wrote that, "Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it." On the other hand, Lenin says, "Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement" and thus we discover a dialectical relationship between *theory* and *praxis*: each one turns back upon the other, clarifying it in an endless process of becoming. 

Of course, from the perspective of historical materialism, only a theory which takes into account the real material conditions and social relations of the historical moment could ever hope to inform a useful revolutionary praxis; however, on the other side of the dichotomy, it is man who creates his material conditions and arranges the social relations he shares with other men on the basis of prior conditions - thus we recall the question from the *Theses on Feuerbach* about "who educates the educator?"

All of a sudden, a philosophy of individual existence enters the stage in the theater of collective action, and here Sartre's notion of *the project* plays a lead role. Simply put, the individual's project is their chosen way of being, expressed through their praxis; that is, through their real activity (collective or otherwise) in understanding and organizing their material conditions and social relations in the light of some end. So technically speaking there is no "the project" per se, rather there are *projects*, but Sartre uses the phrase in its full generality to refer to the way individuals reflect upon their conditions to clarify their philosophy in the first instance and then transform those very conditions in the second. 

> Man defines himself by his project. This material being perpetually goes beyond the condition which is made for him; he reveals and determines his situation by transcending it in order to objectify himself - by work, action, or gesture.

In other words *the project* is a transcendence because its movement of subjectivity entails the going beyond of present conditions, towards a future which at once negates and incorporates them. Man surpasses his situation and reconstitutes himself in relation to his ends, his needs, the sought-after reality, and so on. Through his project the individual "reveals and determines his situation," he locates himself in the totality of history and situates himself in relation to the class struggle, the struggles of race, gender, etc. In fact, Sartre contends that a key aspect distinguishing man from other animals is his ability to be *historical*; that is, Sartre writes, "he can continually define himself by his own *praxis* by means of changes suffered or provoked and their internalization, and then by the very surpassing of the internalized relations." Thus the project is at once an externalization of interiority and at the same time an internalization of exteriority. 

If it is true that man locates himself in the totality of history through action, work and organizing the world in accordance with his vision and creativity, then the project must be the living resultant of this pursuit - man projects himself into the world as a unified subject-object, living and creating the totality through his own particularities. It's interesting that Sartre uses the noun *the project*, which means something like "an objective endeavor" in English, and also at several points connects it to the verb *to project* via the word *projection*, because the latter suggests something like *sending beyond* or *going beyond*, and *the project* does kind of concretize that rather abstract idea.

### <span style="color:#f05454"> The blog as a radical tool </span> <a name="second"></a>

There's an endless depth available for discussion here, and this note isn't supposed to be an exhaustive or comprehensive analysis of the notion of the project within the context of Sartre's existential psychology and Marxist philosophy. Instead, what I want to focus on is how the ideas underlying the Sartrean project can serve as the motivating schemata for conceiving of a blog as an effective instrument in developing a radical Sartrean project -- a project of revolt -- if this is indeed what one wants to make of their project. Since a blog mostly involves writing about stuff, this discussion will necessarily entail an elaboration of the connections between writing, reflection, and the project. So we ask Sartre: how does the individual as reader and writer factor into their project?

> The writer neither foresees nor conjectures; he **projects** ... the writer meets everywhere only **his** knowledge, **his** will, **his** plans, in short, himself ... Thus, by speaking, I reveal the situation by my very intention of changing it; I reveal it to myself and to others in order to change it. I strike at its very heart, I transpierce it, and I display it in full view; at present I dispose of it; with every word I utter, I involve myself a little more in the world, and by the same token I emerge from it a little more, since I go beyond it toward the future.

In this passage Sartre vehemently reaffirms writing as an effective instrument for facilitating a human praxis (unsurprisingly, considering his lifelong profession as a writer). Not only can writing be a valid part of the project he says, but by its very nature the process of writing necessarily becomes a part of the writer's project: in the very act of writing the writer *projects*, he reveals his situation in order to change it, thus unifying the two ends of the theory-praxis dichotomy. In the activity of writing we also rediscover those same key elements of the project which Sartre identified in *Method*: the process involves transcendence, going beyond the present situation and towards the future. One may write in order to set up relations between things in the world, to project an abstraction of your own goals, desires, and objectives onto your creation, or to transcend the world in its fictionalization or elaboration.

When Steinbeck writes *The Grapes of Wrath* he strikes at the "individualist" heart of American conservatism in order to display in full view its intellectual impoverishment, through the plight of the Joad family he transpierces the contradictions inherent in capitalist economic organization. When Ayn Rand writes *Atlas Shrugged* she reflects upon the expropriation of her bourgeois family's private property during the Russian revolution, and through her fiction manufactures a mythologized laissez-faire capitalism in order to vindicate the bourgeois antithesis of her trauma. AndrÃ© Breton engages with a process of automatic writing in order to subvert the linguistic perversion of the French bourgeois cultural hegemony. Evidently some projects are more radical than others. 

It's important to note here that Sartre really is talking about writing in general and not just serious, philosophical or political writing (although in *What is Literature?* he does -- arguably unjustifiably -- express severe disdain for excessively poetic writing). In fact I think he views any kind of writing, fiction or non-fiction, as a valid way of coming to terms with and reflecting upon one's situation. Moreover, even when the writer is totally unaware of the political and philosophical dimensions of their work or intentionally avoids such themes, I think Sartre would identify in that writing a kind of unconscious expression of one's subjective orientation to their materiality and historicity. 

OK, but why is this online platform an appropriate method of projection? Well, Sartre argues that sharing your creative work with other people in some way is a crucial aspect of the creative process.

> It is not true that one writes for himself. That would be the worst blow. In projecting his emotions on paper, one barely manages to give them a languishing extension. The creative act is only an incomplete abstract moment in the production of a work. If the author existed alone he would be able to write as much as he liked; the work as *object* would never see the light of day and he would either have to put down his pen or despair. But the operation of writing implies that of reading as its dialectical correlative and these two connected acts necessitate two distinct agents. It is the conjoint effort of author and reader which brings upon the scene that concrete and imaginary object which is the work of the mind. There is no art except for, and by others.

So, although keeping a secret diary under your bed could stimulate reflection and help you grapple with and understand your situation, Sartre says that this kind of writing is only an "incomplete abstract moment" in the process of writing, the written work lacks a social character as it has not yet been brought into the world as a concrete historical object; reading is the "dialectical correlative" of writing, since the reader facilitates the movement from subjective to objective and the externalization of the internal, they are an essential component of writing when it comes to engaging in praxis as a transcendence. Not that we expect anyone to read this blog, in the same way that any writer is uncertain if anyone will read their work, but I guess the possibility is still there.

In the preceding paragraphs we've established that Sartre thinks writing is a viable tool for developing the individual project, and presumably he would be cool with putting it on a website too. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into much detail; for example, a project could be revolutionary or it could simply perpetuate the status quo, and Sartre doesn't elaborate on how the process of writing and reflection can facilitate a truly radical project, one which externalizes internal desires as revolutionary opportunities and surpasses the present reality towards a future of liberation from subjugation. We will have to fill in the gaps ourselves.

We recall that the project is expressed through praxis, which involves both the internalization and surpassing of one's material, social, and historical situation (towards a future which could either perpetuate or subvert domination); thus, in order to understand the extent to which the blog can function as a tool for developing a genuinely radical project, we must investigate the following two problems:

1. How can writing and discussion facilitate the process of going beyond oneself, and surpassing our present situation towards a future of liberation? Is it not sufficient to simply read a good article or book written from a critical, radical perspective and internalize the words it contains?
2. How can reflection facilitate the process of going beyond oneself, and surpassing our present situation towards a future of liberation?

### <span style="color:#f05454"> Freire's problem-posing pedagogy as a model for the dialogic blog </span> <a name="third"> </a>

We answer the first question by appealing to an analogy between the reader-writer and student-teacher dichotomies vis-Ã -vis Freire's conception of a radical pedagogy. Freire characterizes the form of institutionalized education prevailing in modern capitalist society as a "banking model of education" in which "a narrating Subject (the teacher)" deposits information into the "patient, listening objects (the students)" by means of a pedagogical model which speaks of reality as if it were "motionless, static, compartmentalized, and predictable." There is no communication; students merely receive, memorize, and repeat the instructions bestowed upon them by the teacher. This educational system, Freire says, perpetuates the oppression of marginalized peoples, the destruction of Knowledge and creativity, and the alienation of both the students and the teachers. Moreover, Freire argues that a radical pedagogy of liberation, one involving a dissolution of the contradictions inherent in the student-teacher relationship of the banking model, must be a kind of "problem-posing education". In *The Pedagogy of the Oppressed* Freire writes,

> Indeed, problem-posing education, which breaks with the vertical patterns characteristic of banking education, can fulfill its function as the practice of freedom only if it can overcome the [teacher-student] contradiction. Through dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher cease to exist and a new term emerges: teacher-student with students-teachers. The teacher is no longer merely the-one-who-teaches, but one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while being taught also teach.

The reader-writer relationship is not immediately analogous to the student-teacher relationship because it is necessarily one-sided: there is usually no dialogue between the reader and the writer, whereas Freire argues the student-teacher relation ought to be dialogic. However, in the case of the blog writer reflecting upon his reading during the writing process, the reader and the writer become one -- the reader is in the first instance the student, and then becomes the teacher in the second instance when writing about the text. 

Thus, the silent internalization of the pages of a book entails some of the contradictions of the depositor-depository pedagogy, whereas the dual process of reading and writing facilitated by the blog can be interpreted in terms of the problem-posing pedagogy: this process situates the writer as not merely "the-one-who-teaches" through their writing, but one who is himself taught in dialogue with the past self as reader-student. Of course, this dialogic relationship is even stronger when other people are involved in the project, collaborating and discussing throughout the reading-writing process as a group of teacher-students and student-teachers. "Here, no one teaches another, nor is anyone self-taught. People teach each other, mediated by the world, by the cognizable objects which in banking education are "owned" by the teacher." Freire is explicit in his affirmation of this kind of mutual dialogue as an important mechanism for liberation.

> [Dialogue] is an act of creation; it must not serve as a crafty instrument for the domination of one person by another. The domination implicit in dialogue is that of the world by the dialogues; it is conquest of the world for the liberation of humankind.

Freire delineates several crucial aspects of this dialogue which suggest to us the appropriate tone for the blog as an instrument for a radical project; namely, Freire emphasizes that there can be no dialogue without humility, hope, faith in humankind, and critical thinking. We must exercise humility: how can we engage in a program of mutual learning and understanding if any one of us considers ourselves the sole owners of truth and knowledge? How can I dialogue if I regard myself as superior or dismiss the contributions of others? "At the point of encounter there are neither utter ignoramuses nor perfect sages," Freire writes, "there are only people who are attempting, together, to learn more than they now know." Moreover, he says there can be no dialogue without hope:

> Hopelessness is a form of silence, of denying the world and fleeing from it. The dehumanization resulting from an unjust order is not a cause for despair but for hope, leading to the incessant pursuit of the humanity denied by injustice.

Reflecting on these ideas, we derive the foundations for a project of revolt. In general, we will always aim to convey a sense of humility, tones of hope and faith in humanity, and always remain critical in our analysis -- we are in agreement with Marx when he says that our affair involves a "ruthless criticism of all that exists" -- in particular this means skepticism of every established doctrine, capitalist, socialist, or otherwise.

### <span style="color:#f05454"> Marcuse's contemplative culture-hero as a symbol of radical reflection </span> <a name="fourth"></a>

We answer the second question by appealing to Marcuse's radical interpretation of the Greek myths of the contemplative heroes Orpheus and Narcissus in *Eros and Civilization*. Searching Greek mythology for cultural heroes who symbolize a very different reality from the prevailing capitalist reality of ceaseless toil, productivity and progress through repression, Marcuse recalls the stories of Orpheus and Narcissus: Orpheus, the prodigal musician and poet of Thrace whose song "pacifies the animal world, reconciles the lion with the lamb and the lion with man," and Narcissus, who, in the mirror of the water, tries to grasp his own beauty, who bends over and the river of time and implores "Alas, when will Time cease its flight and allow this flow to rest?" 

Contrary to the orthodox academic interpretation of these heroes as "miraculous, incredible, superhuman" with stories that are at best "poetic, something for the soul and the heart," Marcuse says instead that the images of Orpheus and Narcissus "recall the experience of a world that is not to be mastered and controlled but to be liberated -- a freedom that will release the powers of Eros now bound in the repressed and petrified forms of man and nature." The Orphic experience is one which reconciles man and nature, recognizes the beauty in nature for itself and sees nature as an end-in-itself. Rejecting the predominant reality principle which demands toil and perpetuates repression, "Orpheus is the archetype of the poet as liberator and creator: he establishes a higher order in the world -- an order without repression. In his person, art, freedom, and culture are eternally combined." In a similar vein, the Narcissistic experience is one which reconciles subject with object -- the subject outside of the reflection and the object of beauty in the reflection. He is enraptured not with the beauty of the man he sees reflected in the river, but with the unity of the man with nature in the image of man superimposed upon nature. 

Through their contemplation of art and nature Orpheus and Narcissus both offer "another existential relation to reality" and hint at "a non-repressive mode of sublimation which results from an extension rather than from a constraining deflection of the libido." Orpheus and Narcissus reject the established system of domination, they "protest against the repressive order of procreative sexuality," and ultimately "reveal a new reality, with an order of its own, governed by different principles." Thus, they master cruelty and death through liberation, "[Orpheus'] language is *song* and his work is *play*. Narcissus' life is that of *beauty* and his existence is *contemplation*."

The reconciliation between subject and object represented by the contemplative, aesthetic *projects* of Orpheus and Narcissus indicates the intrinsically radical potentialities of the comprehension facilitated by reflection within writing since, as Marcuse suggests elsewhere in *Eros and Civilization*,

> ... the logic of domination does not triumph unchallenged. The philosophy which epitomizes the antagonistic relation between subject and object also retains the image of their reconciliation. The restless labor of the transcending subject terminates in the ultimate unity of subject and object: the idea of "being-in-and-for-itself," existing in its own fulfillment.

Of course, writing and reflection cannot constitute the full extent of a truly radical project because such a project necessarily entails the transformative aspects of radical praxis: revolutionary action, political organization, involvement in the community, etc. But there is historical precedent for the unification of art and praxis in pursuit of revolutionary objectives. As Frederic Rosemont writes in the fourth volume of the journal *Radical America*, the struggle against bourgeois ideology, the struggle against "the iron bars of bureaucratic sociology and the miserable glue of patriotism, respect for property, religion, advertising, education, etc." is the struggle against ideological deception, and "to attack this deception, to tear away this mask, is to provide ground for the revolutionary movement to advance on; it is to clarify our perception of the terrain on which we must fight." Thus, from the perspective of surrealism, Rosemont asserts that

> This task of revolutionary revaluation necessarily commences with the theory and practice of poetry ... But let no one confuse this point of departure for a point of arrival; our unreserved adherence to the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, our active participation in concrete political struggles and on militant demonstrations, should be sufficient proof that our conception of poetry does not end with the poem.

In the journal *Surrealism in the service of the revolution*, Andre Breton argues along similar lines, that "opposed to the theory of Art for Art's sake, as well as to the theory of engaged art, surrealism reaffirms that in the present state of reality (in which men possess
only a fragmented and alienated perception), art, to be revolutionary, can
seek its substance only on unknown terrain" and therefore the specific function of the revolutionary artist is "to liberate the powers and desires immobilized in the unconscious."

At this point we've stumbled upon a key element of the surrealist project: the capacity for art to unlock the repressed freedom-desire, to tear language away from the repressive state apparatus and to make it the instrument of the pleasure principle. The precise details of this analysis inevitably rely upon a theory of psychoanalysis, usually Freudian, which is somewhat outside the scope of the present note. As a result, we will content ourselves with a few brief remarks made by Marcuse in *Eros and Civilization* about the radical potentialities of surrealism in relation to the mental processes of imagination or phantasy. 

Imagination, Marcuse says, "retains the structure and the tendencies of the psyche prior to its organization by the reality, prior to its becoming an 'individual' set off against other individuals," and thus preserves the memory of a subhistorical past prior to the subjugation of the pleasure principle by the reality principle, a time of freedom from want, toil, and oppression. Therefore, imagination militates against the antagonistic human reality and "sustains the claim of the whole individual" to this archaic past. Marcuse writes,

> Imagination envisions the reconciliation of the individual with the whole, of desire with realization, of happiness with reason. While this harmony has been removed into utopia by the established reality principle, phantasy insists that it must and can become real, that behind the illusion lies **knowledge**. 

According to Marcuse, behind the aesthetic form "lies the repressed harmony of sensuousness and reason" and "the eternal protest against the organization of life by the logic of domination," from which it follows that the concealed truths of imagination are revealed during the artistic creation of a subjective-objective universe of perception and comprehension. Thus the surrealists, Marcuse says, "recognized the revolutionary implications of Freud's discoveries" when they demanded that the dream, the imaginary manifestation of the unconscious, be made into reality without compromising its content.

All of this is simply to say that the activities (learning, exploring, creating, reflecting, etc.) involved in the development of the kind radical project outlined in the preceding discussion, do appear to be facilitated by a blog structured along the lines of dialogue and phantasy. Moreover, the specific medium of the blog happens to be a particularly convenient means for us (the blog authors) to engage in the aformentioned kind of activity (given that we enjoy the privileges of living in the wealthy geographic center of the global capitalist-imperialist order). As a result, we intend this blog to facilitate that process of education and exploration, to stimulate reflection and discussion amongst ourselves and our friends, and to simply track our intellectual development as we carry on our never-ending movement of subjectivity.

### <span style="color:#f05454"> Open questions </span> <a name="fifth"></a>

In the spirit of radical humility, we would like to end with a discussion of some open questions which came to mind in the process of writing and reflecting upon this note. We believe these questions could lead to fruitful or interesting lines of future inquiry, but as yet we have no definitive solutions to offer.

1. In the second section of this note we quickly accepted, without hesitation, that the technologically advanced "online website" medium for sharing one's writing is just as acceptable as any other commonly utilized medium, such as newspaper or online journal. In other words, we haven't really worried about whether the *form* compromises the *content* or vice versa. 

   Perhaps this problem warrants a greater degree of care; for example, in his 1954 essay *How to Look at Television*, Adorno investigates the "sociopsychological stimuli typical of televised material both on a descriptive and psychodynamic level, to analyze their presuppositions as well as their total pattern, and to evaluate the effect they are likely to produce" in contrast to other less technological mediums for entertainment and information dissemination. He writes, for example, that

   > the technology of television production makes stereotypy almost inevitable. The short time available for the preparation of scripts and the vast material continuously to be produced call for certain formulas ... The more stereotypes become reified and rigid in the present setup of cultural industry, the less people are likely to change their preconceived ideas with the progress of their experience.

   Thus, we might ask, what potentialities for social engagement, beneficial or adverse, does our choice of medium present, and how can we gain the former while avoiding the latter?

2. It is extremely difficult not to think about the seemingly inescapable problem of recuperation -- the incorporation of radical or subversive political, social, or cultural practices into the established universe of discourse in order to neutralize their revolutionary power. If, through our writing or any other artistic pursuit, we seek to build a radical project which militates against the discursive boundaries delineated by the established universe, then it seems that we will have to grapple with the historical reality of recuperation: even the most subversive and class-conscious social movements have seen their art forms incorporated into the dominant paradigms of capitalist ideology, finding themselves reduced to symbols which merely reproduce the relations they sought to dismantle. 

   The problem of recuperation is especially relevant in the context of our previous discussion because some of the concrete examples we used to indicate the radical potentialities of the aesthetic, contemplative project, have themselves fallen victim to the process of recuperation. As Guy Debord writes in his 1957 essay *Report on the Construction of Situations*,

   > The bourgeoisie must above all prevent a new beginning of revolutionary thought. It was aware of the danger of surrealism. Now that it has been able to coopt it into ordinary aesthetic commerce, it would like people to believe that surrealism was the most radical and disturbing movement possible. It thus cultivates a sort of nostalgia for surrealism at the same time that it discredits any new venture by automatically pigeonholing it as a rehash of surrealism, a rerun of a defeat which according to it is definitive and can no longer be brought back into question by anyone.

   In this essay Debord identifies what he considers to be some theoretical problems at the root of surrealist thought, and it might be fruitful to study his analysis in the context of the problem of recuperation; e.g. how was the recuperative susceptibility of surrealist art related to these theoretical shortcomings? Moreover, Naomi Klein notes in her book *No Logos* that, despite their deep awareness of the ideological vulnerabilities at play, the Situationists' own strategy of dÃ©tournement has been vulnerable to bourgeois recuperation. With these examples in mind, we must submit to critical introspection the question: how do we resist recuperation?

3. Of course, we ought to be aware of our own biases resulting from our personal backgrounds and socialization (within the western imperialist core or whatever the case may be), and the myriad ways these biases may color our understanding of what we read and how we engage with the material. In this vein, we ought to introspect our own class positions and how they inform our analysis and praxis. Marcuse alludes to the importance of this enterprise in his introduction to *Eros and Civilization*, where he writes,

   > To the degree to which organized labor operates in defense of the status quo, and to the degree to which the share of labor in the material process of production declines, intellectual skills and capabilities become social and political factors.

   Thus, in light of the role they play in the organs of knowledge production and with their contributions to the production of material and intellectual instruments which are weaponized in service of the ruling class, "the scientists, mathematicians, technicians, industrial psychologists and public opinion pollsters" have the unique ability to prepare the ground for political action through their organized refusal to cooperate. Regarding mathematics specifically, the recently established [Just Mathematics Collective](https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/) seems to be an interesting representative of the kind of refusal Marcuse is thinking about.

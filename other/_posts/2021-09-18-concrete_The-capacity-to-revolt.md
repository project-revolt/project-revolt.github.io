## <span style="color:#f05454">Camus' Colonial Claims on Freedom</span><a name="1"></a>

In his 1951 text *L'Homme révolté* (The Rebel), French existentialist philosopher Albert Camus examines the historical development of the concept and practice of rebellion. He writes that "*history today, with all its storm and strife, compels us to say that rebellion is one of the **essential dimensions of man***." Strangely, a few lines above this emphatic declaration he writes:

> Reasons for rebellion do seem to change, in fact, with periods and civilizations. It is obvious that a Hindu pariah, an Inca warrior, a primitive native of central Africa, and a member of one of the first Christian communities had not at all the same ideas about rebellion. 
>
> We could even assert, with considerable assurance, that the idea of rebellion has no meaning in these particular cases. However, a Greek slave, a serf, a condottiere of the Renaissance, a Parisian bourgeois during the Regency, a Russian intellectual at the beginning of the twentieth century, and a contemporary worker would undoubtedly agree that rebellion is legitimate, even if they differed about the reasons for it. In other words, **the problem of rebellion seems to assume a precise meaning only within the confines of Western thought**. It is possible to be even more explicit by remarking, like Scheler, that the spirit of rebellion finds few means of expression in societies where inequalities are very great (the Hindu caste system) or, again, in those where there is absolute equality (certain primitive societies). The spirit of rebellion can exist only in a society where a theoretical equality conceals great factual inequalities. **The problem of rebellion, therefore, has no meaning except within our own Western society** . . . [Thanks] to the theory of political freedom, there is, in the very heart of our [Western] society, an increasing awareness in man of the idea of man and, thanks to the application of this theory of freedom, a corresponding dissatisfaction . . . In fact, **for the Inca and the pariah the problem never arises, because for them it had been solved by a tradition, even before they had had time to raise it**—the answer being that tradition is sacred.

<!--One might be tempted to affirm that it is relative to the development of individualism if the preceding remarks had not put us on our guard against this conclusion. On the basis of the evidence, the only conclusion that can be drawn from Scheler's remark is that, thanks to the theory of political freedom, there is, in the very heart of our society, an increasing awareness in man of the idea of man and, thanks to the application of this theory of freedom, a corresponding dissatisfaction. Actual freedom has not increased in proportion to man's awareness of it. We can only deduce from this observation that rebellion is the act of an educated man who is aware of his own rights. But there is nothing which justifies us in saying that it is only a question of individual rights. Because of the sense of solidarity we have already pointed out, it would rather seem that what is at stake is humanity's gradually increasing self-awareness as it pursues its course. In fact,--> 

<!--//-->

<!--. . . for the Inca and the pariah the problem [of rebellion] never arises, because for them it had been solved by a tradition, even before they had had time to raise it—the answer being that tradition is sacred. If in a world where things are held sacred the problem of rebellion does not arise, it is because no real problems are to be found in such a world, all the answers having been given simultaneously. Metaphysic is replaced by myth. There are no more questions, only eternal answers and commentaries, which may be metaphysical. But before man accepts the sacred world and in order that he should be able to accept it— or before he escapes from it and in order that he should be able to escape from it—there is always a period of soul-searching and rebellion. The rebel is a man who is on the point of accepting or rejecting the sacred and determined on laying claim to a human situation in which all the answers are human—in other words, formulated in reasonable terms. From this moment every question, every word, is an act of rebellion while in the sacred world every word is an act of grace-->

<!--//-->
In these few sentences, Camus denies the capacity to reflect, to be self-aware, to negate, and to enact change, for entire groups of peoples and histories. At first it seems ridiculous that he is writing this in a text on Revolt at a time when anti-colonial revolts are spreading throughout the Global South. Perhaps it is not so ridiculous, considering his [reactionary position on the Algerian national liberation struggle](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/10/colonialism-albert-camus-france-algeria-sartre) *(see great 1966 film The Battle of Algiers for more on this struggle). It seems fair to say he has the colonizer's perspective. 

Nevertheless, the history of the concepts of freedom and rebellion remains vital to pursue. Here, I begin my inquiry with M.I. Finley's studies of ancient Greece to learn about the claim that freedom has a unique root in "Western thought." I lay out his historical analysis of ancient Greece, examine his arguments, and briefly compare them with later critical work by Orlando Patterson. In <u>the next post</u>, I move on to research on ancient Indian history, motivated by my longstanding desire to critically study my home and to find further evidence on Camus' claims (the Hindu pariah i.e. member of a low-caste group happens to be the first in the list of peoples Camus denies the capacity for revolt). Unsurprisingly, I realized that this is too vast a question to investigate and present in a few blog posts, so I end with a series of open questions for further research.

### <span style="color:#f05454">What did freedom mean in ancient Greece?</span><a name="2a"></a>

Finley is very careful in restraining the scope of his analysis and qualifying his claims. With the concept of freedom, he immediately notes that there can be no universal definition, that it is thoroughly historically conditioned, and that it is ultimately a reified abstraction that emerges from a struggle over specific issues. 

What, then, was the ancient Greek (c. 5th Century BCE, particularly focusing on Athens) conception of freedom? Finley articulates it as a "bundle of claims, privileges, powers, and immunities" an individual possessed, typically in relation to the state and property. In this sense, the citizens of the *polis* were more free than the slave population. Citizens possessed special privileges such as:

- the right to engage in *stasis* or civil strife, i.e., to combine with others and advocate for change in the political arena
- the right to obtain state assistance in the distribution of grain
- *isegoria*, the right to speak and make proposals in the Assembly
- *isonomia*, the principle of "equality before the law"
  - This was obviously the most difficult right to translate into practice in a hierarchical class society. As Finley says "Self-help [for legal redress] is a workable procedure between equals: it weights the scales heavily in the case of unequals."
- the right to own slaves
  - Finley quotes from the pseudo-Aristotelian *Oeconomica*: "Of property, the first and most necessary kind, the best and most manageable, is man."
- the right to manumit (legally emancipate) one's slaves
  - Some "efficient, skilled, reliable" slaves could accumulate earnings to purchase their manumission. Notably, manumission did not entail citizenship as it did later in Rome. Manumission was a significant phenomenon in ancient Greece, one of the many important distinctions with slavery in the American South.

There were also important limitations on the freedom of the citizen, especially in "any activity that entailed the introduction of new members into the closed circle of the citizen-body," including prohibition of marriage between a citizen and a non-citizen. Further, "Athenian women had fewer claims to an inheritance than the women of Sparta or Crete."

Finley draws the following broad conclusion from this articulation:

> . . . the classical Greek polis had evolved an institutional system which, of itself, was capable of formulating, sanctioning, and when necessary changing the intricate network of rights and duties that are subsumed under the label 'freedom'.

This begins to suggest what made Greek society exceptional compared to other ancient societies. Before we can consider that, we need to ask:

### <span style="color:#f05454">What was the social structure of ancient Greece?</span><a name="2b"></a>

In *Was Greek civilisation based on slave labour?* (1959) and *Between slavery and freedom* (1964), Finley describes the "spectrum of statuses" between slave and free citizen in ancient Greek society:

- Chattel slaves: The "decisive figure" in the advanced Greek communities. Although there are no great reliable data, even the lowest of the low estimates put the proportion at one slave for each adult citizen. A reasonable estimate of the proportion of society in slavery may be around thirty per cent, in contrast with most other parts of the ancient world where slavery was of minor significance and "would have been no more than between one and five per cent of the total population"--indeed, ancient Greece "was the first group of societies in world history to become dependent on large-scale slavery." (Patterson, 1984)
  - They did all kinds of work barring political and military activity, playing significant roles in agriculture and manufacture, and prevailing in mining and quarrying. 
  - In the domestic field, it can be taken as a rule "that any free man who possibly could afford one, owned a slave attendant . . . and also a slave woman for the household chores."
  - Slaves came primarily through the capture of 'foreigners,' victims of war, and sometimes piracy.
- Debt-bondsmen: Members of the polis forced into servitude for a given period due to debt. Not slaves, although under some conditions could be sold into slavery abroad.
- Conditionally manumitted slaves (including for instance obligations toward the ex-master)
- Freedmen: emancipated slaves, although not citizens.

Finley compares the classic Greek city structure with that of Sparta, where chattel slaves were "wholly insignificant." Instead, there was a large servile population known as helots. The helots had several distinguishing features:

- unlike chattel slaves who were 'outsiders,' helots "were not foreigners but a subject people working their own lands in a state of servitude" bound together by ties of "kinship, nationhood . . . and tradition."
- They had property rights of a kind, with law permitting them to retain everything they produced beyond the fixed deliveries to their masters
- Outnumbered free population on a scale without parallel in Greek communities.
- They belonged to the state and not to individual Spartiates to whom they were assigned. Thus only the state could free them, as it sometimes did in the need for military service.

### <span style="color:#f05454">Patterns of revolt and the slave's relation to freedom</span><a name="2c"></a>

In *Between slavery and freedom* (1964), Finley poses the problem of the revolt patterns in ancient Greece. As noted before, the class structure of Athens included debt-bondage, i.e., the institution of servitude for debt by Athenian citizens that deprived them of most rights during their service period. Revolt by these Athenian bondsmen "was one of the most significant factors in the early history of both Greece and Rome," most famously asserted through Solon's abolition of debt-bondage in c. 594 BCE. Notably, this was the result of a political struggle:

> Athenian bondsmen had remained Athenians; now they re-asserted their rights as Athenians, and they forced an end to the institution - servitude for debt - which had deprived them *de facto* of all or most of these rights. They were not opposed to slavery as such, only to the subject of Athenians by other Athenians. Hence, whatever the superficial similarity, **this was not a slave revolt.**

Similarly, in 464 BCE a great helot revolt broke out in Sparta which was suppressed by the Spartans with the help of Athenian forces. Again, this was a different social strata of people above chattel slaves and more akin to medieval serfs. Their revolt, like that of the debt-bondsmen, was to abolish their particular form of servitude, "though not, significantly, to abolish all forms, and particularly not chattel slavery."

Chattel slaves "showed no tendency at any time in Greek history" and in most of Roman history to revolt. This of course did not mean that slaves did not protest their condition. Fleeing "was a chronic and sufficiently numerous phenomenon in the Greek cities," a significant risk in itself that often ended in death or re-enslavement. Nevertheless,

> . . . the chattels, who were both the most rightless of all the servile types and the most complete outsiders in every sense, were precisely those who showed the weakest tendency to cohesive action, the weakest drive to secure freedom . . . **Slaves as slaves showed no interest in slavery as an institution** . . . In so far as they thought about freedom, in other words, **they accepted the prevailing notion completely: freedom for them, as individuals, included the right to possess other individuals as slaves.**

How shall we understand this disparity in revolt pattern?

### <span style="color:#f05454">Ideological and material conditions</span><a name="2d"></a>

#### <span style="color:#f05454">The elite</span><a name="2d.i"></a>

Ancient Greece was a society filled with remarkably open and critical dialogue:

> The Greek world was one of endless debate and challenge. Among the intellectuals, **no belief or idea was self-evident: every conception and every institution sooner or later came under attack** - religious beliefs, ethical values, political systems, aspects of the economy, even bedrock institutions as the family and private property. 

Yet, opposition to the institution of slavery was nowhere to be found. The Greek conception of freedom was by no means a universal one:

> . . . the Greek view was virtually unanimous: there was no contradiction, in their minds, between freedom for some and (partial or total) unfreedom for others, no notion that all men are created free, let alone equal.

In fact, the right to own slaves seems essential to their conception of freedom. 

> Structurally and ideologically, dependent labour was integral, indispensable . . . Most revealing of all is the firm implication in many ancient texts, and often the explicit statement, that one element of freedom was the freedom to enslave others.

This sense is brought out not only in extreme examples such as Aristotle's attempt to formulate a rigorous doctrine of 'natural slavery' ("a doctrine which was combatted in his own day and generally rejected by philosophers in later generations"), but also in commonplace ones such as a case in c. 400 BCE where a disabled Athenian, about to be taken off of public assistance because of the amount of property he owned, formally appeals to the Council on the grounds that he "could not yet afford to buy a slave." 

None of the radical critical thinkers of Athens, neither Plato nor the "believers in the brotherhood of man (whether Cynic, Stoic, or early Christian)," opposed slavery as such. Even Diogenes, according to legend, was once seized by pirates and taken to auction where he pointed to a certain Corinthian among the buyers and said "Sell me to him; he needs a master."

</center>


While the Greeks did attempt to "denigrate the majority of their slaves with the 'barbarian' label,"  overall there was not a racial ideological or philosophical (in Aristotle's sense of 'natural slavery') justification for slavery as the 'barbarian' category was simply too weak a classification, too many were slaves "'by accident', by the chance of warfare or shipwreck or kidnapping," and manumission too widespread. Roman lawyers formulating the definition of the institution of slavery even went so far as agreeing that it is "contrary to nature," thus that it was defensible only on the ground that it was indispensable for their economy.  

#### <span style="color:#f05454">The free poor</span><a name="2d.ii"></a>

Finley asks what the "free poor" or "the little man" might have thought about slavery, and finds that "through the centuries no ideology of labour appeared," nothing that opposed the ideas of the ruling class about the necessity and inevitability of toil and slavery. The opportunity for this was not lacking:

> There is nothing remotely resembling a workers' programme, no wage demands, no talk of working conditions or government employment measures or the like. In a city like Athens there was ample opportunity. The *demos* [ordinary citizens] had power, enough of them were poor, and they had leaders.

Even "when crisis turned into civil war and revolution," the free poor were not ever interested in "joining with the slaves in a common struggle." This was not because of relative comfort or the chance for upward mobility:

> A large section of the [free] Greek population was always on the edge of marginal subsistence. **They worked hard for their livelihood and could not look forward to economic advancement** as a reward for their labours; on the contrary, **if they moved at all, it was likely to be downward.**

#### <span style="color:#f05454">The slave</span><a name="2d.iii"></a>

Finley notes that reconstructing the "psychology of the slave" is most difficult. He lays out the sparse pieces of evidence which make some inference possible:

- The lack of "that deep-rooted and often neurotic" fear of slave rebellion (known in other societies such as the antebellum American South) among the free Greeks
- The fact that some slaves fought for their masters in wars, especially when freedom was a promised reward
- Incentive structures where "the efficient, skilled, reliable slave could look forward to managerial status" and even a "quasi-independence, living and working on his own." The greatest incentive was manumission, which, although data are lacking, was a common phenomenon. 

Of course, revolt is no easy task--"a large-scale rebellion is impossible to organise and carry through except under very unusual circumstances." To explain the revolts that did occur from servile classes such as the Spartan helot revolt, Finley suggests the "peculiar factors" that distinguished helots from slaves--their ties of kinship and nationhood, limited property rights, no possibility of manumission, and their vast outnumbering of the free population. He especially disapproves of explanations of revolt patterns in terms of the level of "misery and oppression", for instance that Greek slaves did not revolt because they were treated well, or that helots did revolt because they were treated worse. Finley quotes Frederick Douglass' *My Bondage and My Freedom* (1855) which he sees as "the most penetrating analysis to come from an ex-slave":

> Beat and cuff your slave, keep him hungry and spiritless, and he will follow the chain of his master like a dog; but feed and clothe him with physical comfort, and dreams of freedom intrude. Give him a ***bad*** master, and he aspires to a ***good*** master; give him a good master, and he wishes to become his ***own*** master.

### <span style="color:#f05454">What makes ancient Greece an exceptional society?</span><a name="2e"></a>

In *Was Greek civilisation based on slave labour?* (1959), Finley writes:

> More bluntly put, **the cities in which individual freedom reached its highest expression - most obviously Athens - were cities in which chattel slavery flourished. The Greeks, it is well known, discovered both the idea of individual freedom and the institutional framework in which it could be realised.** The pre-Greek world - the world of the Sumerians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and Assyrians; and I cannot refrain from adding the Mycenaeans - was, in a very profound sense, a world without free men, in the sense in which the west has come to understand that concept. It was equally a world in which chattel slavery played no role of any consequence. That, too, was a Greek discovery. **One aspect of Greek history, in short, is the advance, hand in hand, of freedom and slavery.**

These claims are evidenced in part by language: "Customarily Greek and Roman writers were not concerned with such nuances" of social statuses between slavery and freedom. The Greeks had precise words for the opposite ends of the spectrum: *douleia* - slavery; *despotes* - master; *eleutheros* - a free man. Moreover, for Finley, "the emergence of the idea of freedom" finds its first literary statement in "the long poem, the *Works and Days,* in which Hesiod, an independent Boeotian landowner of seventh century BC, presumed freely to criticise his betters, the 'gift-devouring princes' with their 'crooked judgments'." Freedom was thus a definable concept for the Greeks as a consequence of the sharp, meaningful social antinomy of slave-free.

#### <span style="color:#f05454">Comparison with Eastern societies</span><a name="2e.i"></a>

In contrast, in the ancient Near East or in the earliest periods of Greek and Roman history, there were more distributed categories of statuses shading into each other. There, "freedom is not a useful category and therefore it is pointless to ask where one draws the line between the free and the unfree." In one of his only remarks on Eastern societies, Finley writes: 

> Sometimes the results [of this unique history of freedom in the West] are amusing, as in the first efforts in the Far East in the nineteenth century to cope with the word 'freedom' for which they had no synonym and which till then was 'scarcely possible' in, say, Chinese.

The citation here is E.G. Pulleyblank's 1958 *The Origins and Nature of Chattel Slavery in China*. Commenting on a broad period leading up to the second century BC, Pulleyblank writes:

> The condition of a slave did not stand in Chinese law in contrast to that of a "free man", an expression which would have been scarcely possible in Chinese prior to the introduction of western ideas in the nineteenth century, since no conception of positive freedom could exist in an organic society where every man's position was defined by his social relationships, which carried with them not demarcated rights and limited corresponding duties but moral obligations to superiors - ruler, father, elder brother, husband - that were by their nature absolute and unlimited. The distinction was rather between the slave (*nu-pi*) who was "base" (*chien*) and the "ordinary people" (*shu-jen*) who were "good" (*liang*). 

Pulleyblank cites a 1952 text by Kimura Ki for "the introduction of the concept of freedom into Japan," a source I have been unable to locate and which may not have an English translation. Nevertheless, Pulleyblank's claims are dubious to say the least. It is not at all clear what makes the "moral obligations" of individuals in ancient China "absolute and unlimited" and whether in practice they did or did not mean "demarcated rights and limited corresponding duties." 

### <span style="color:#f05454">Recapitulation</span><a name="2f"></a>

There are two related conceptions of freedom Finley talks about: 'positive' and 'negational' freedom (I refrain from using the term 'negative' for its association with John Stuart Mill's 'libertarian position', which roughly means the absence of interference, something Finley himself criticizes as slippery and 'doggedly negative'). Positive freedom corresponds to a bundle of claims an individual possesses in relation to the state and property. It is not at all clear that ancient Greece was the unique birthplace of such a conception, and in fact it cannot be clear without a detailed study of other ancient societies.

Negational freedom emerges as a useful, meaningful category in societies with sharp social polarizations into slave and free statuses. As Finley says, "the concept of 'freedom' can properly be formulated (only) as the antithesis of 'unfreedom.''' Thus, when Finley claims that freedom was uniquely "invented" in ancient Greece, this seems to be the conception he has in mind. The idea is that the 'special' socioeconomic stratification and ideological conditions of Greek society uniquely allowed freedom to become a definable concept, corresponding to the absolute negation of the slave status and including special political rights, especially and perhaps essentially the right to own slaves. 

Notably, there seems to be no "theoretical equality [concealing] great factual inequalities" in ancient Greece that Camus suggests when he mentions the meaning of rebellion for the Greek slave. It appears that the ruling class ideology of the necessity and inevitability of slavery was totally dominant, with no conception whatsoever of universal human rights or freedom, such that even the revolts and demands of other servile statuses and poor populations were towards personal enfranchisement and the right to own slaves.

## <span style="color:#f05454">Reflection and comparison with later scholars</span><a name="3"></a>

In the works surveyed so far, there is very little explicit discussion of Eastern societies and what is there is far from rigorous. For instance, even if it was accepted that the ancient Chinese had no word for freedom, there is far too little context even in the cited works to conclude that people in ancient China did not have any conception of freedom or revolt (both of which are quite distinct and do not imply each other as we have seen) and that the West uniquely invented these conceptions.

Nevertheless, Finley's broad argument is one that makes intuitive sense: individual freedom becomes a possible concept only in societies with institutional frameworks capable of actualizing freedom for a section of its people and that have sharp slave-free antinomies. It should be noted that the details of Finley's argument have undergone significant scholarly debate. In *Freedom in the Making of Western Culture* (1991), preeminent historical sociologist Orlando Patterson writes:

> **[Finley's] argument ran as follows: first, freedom emerged as a result of a peculiar configuration of historical circumstances in the late seventh and early sixth centuries B.C.; this then stimulated the unprecedented rise of large-scale slavery**; and this, in turn, became the socioeconomic foundation or "basis" for the civilization in which classical democracy flourished. Thus, while large-scale slavery was a structural precondition for classical freedom, it was the latter that historically triggered the former. **He explicitly rejected the thesis that is central to [my] work, and to that of Pohlenz and Raaflaub: that the very idea and valuation of freedom was generated by the existence and growth of slavery.** 

<center>
<figure class="image">
    <img src="/images/OrlandoPatterson.png" alt="Orlando Patterson"/>
</figure>
</center>
Patterson explicitly negotiates the different historical meanings of 'freedom' in *Slavery: The underside of freedom* (1984), answering one of our earlier questions about 'positive freedom' and whether it is unique to the West:

> [Another] way in which [freedom] is used may be called 'organic freedom'. **This refers to the capacity of adult members of a community to participate in its life and government**. This is the right to what the Greeks understood as citizenship . . . **This is minimal democracy. It is not, however, the same thing as personal freedom** . . . **Nor, further, is citizenship a peculiarly Western development.** I find ethnocentric claims of Western historians, especially classical scholars, rather tiresome on this subject. **Instead of citing evidence to the contrary I merely suggest that the sceptical browse through any anthropology textbook on tribal politics in Asia and Africa.**

### <span style="color:#f05454">What is slavery?</span><a name="3a"></a>

Towards uncovering the link between slavery and freedom, Patterson provides a systematic comparative study of sixty-six societies over time, defining slavery as "**a state of social death**" constituted by personal domination of a natally alienated, perpetually dishonored individual--"someone, or the descendent of someone, who should have died." Resonating with Frederick Douglass' words quoted earlier, Patterson further clarifies the essential dialectic from which the concept of freedom emerges, why and for whom it becomes valuable:

> Who were the first persons to have the unusual idea that being free was not only a value to be cherished but the most important thing that someone could possess? The answer, in a word, is slaves. **Freedom began its career as a social value in the desperate yearning of the slave to negate what for him, and for non-slaves, was a peculiarly inhuman condition . . . [The] idea of freedom has never been divorced from this, its primordial servile source.**

Patterson explains that slavery "poses a fundamental problem" of motivation, where the degraded, socially dead slave "would seem to have no reason or desire to serve his master." The institution "by its very nature provides a novel solution," that of holding out the promise of manumission, of freedom, to the slave. This promise functions with a vile elegance: "The more the master impresses upon the slave social death, the more he degrades him, the more the latter yearns, desires, hopes for a negation of this terrible state of non-being." In practice, this results in slaves that toil for nearly their entire lives in order to accumulate enough to pay the masters for their freedom. Patterson asks:

> What on earth, one must ask, does the slave think he is doing? What has he gained? Rarely material security. Rarely, also, complete personal independence  . . . The freedom did not necessarily gain, either, any of the specific powers the master had over him . . . **What the freedman experienced, the essential core of his freedom, was the negation of his generalized condition of social death. Implicit in this was his rebirth.** Freedom was the negation which resulted in life. We arrive then at **the single most important quality defining freedom, that it exists always in dialectical relation with the horror of social death; that to be meaningful, to have content, it requires the idea of its opposite.**

We recall Marcuse's striking words, "Under the rule of a repressive whole, liberty can be made into a powerful instrument of domination," and are shocked to see that Patterson takes us even further, showing that **liberty in fact began as an instrument of domination**. 

### <span style="color:#f05454">The ancient Greek moment</span><a name="3b"></a>

Patterson's articulation of freedom seems to be a powerful explanation for the ideological conditions and disparity in revolt patterns in ancient Greece noted earlier. He argues that for the Greek intellectual elite and most free-born Greeks, "citizenship was to remain the supreme value," something they never confused with freedom. Regarding personal freedoms and claims on the state, he writes:

> [The average Greek] took these 'freedoms' for granted in the same way that he would have taken his right to perform his bodily functions for granted. It would never have occurred to any free-born Greek to celebrate them. To do so would have been to reveal the shame of once having been enslaved.

No, freedom in ancient Greece was primarily of value to slaves, especially the substantial number who "experienced the negation of death and the rebirth which was freedom." Many of these freedmen were literate and could thus reflect on and refine the idea of freedom:

> It was among the **Stoics** that we find philosophical reflections on freedom most developed. To be sure, they **thought of personal freedom mainly in terms of spiritual liberation**, a major development, for it was to provide the Western tradition with **the standard way of circumventing the radical implications of the idea of freedom**[.]

Epictetus (c. 50-135 CE) was one of the important Stoics and the only ancient philosopher I know of who was born a slave.

### <span style="color:#f05454">Uniqueness and ethnocentrism</span><a name="3c"></a>

Patterson does assert that the concept of negational freedom--the absolute negation of the slave status--was a peculiarly Western value and ideal despite slavery being a near universal institution. In *Freedom in the Making of Western Culture*, he writes that:

> **[While] the idea of freedom was certainly engendered wherever slavery existed, it never came to term.** People everywhere, except in the ancient West, resisted its gestation and institutionalization . . . It will be seen that resisting the promotion of freedom as value was the natural thing to do for most human soceities.

The details of his argument relate to the peculiarity of Christianity and are worth delving into in a later post, especially considering its links to "sacred traditions" that Camus vulgarly ascribes to all non-western societies. What should be emphasized here is the ethnocentric lens with which most thinkers have dealt with this history. Patterson argues:

> What is unusual is the institutionalization and idealization of this value, given its degraded, servile source. **It is the ancient West that needs explanation**. Because we are of the West and share its central value, **we have turned the history of human societies around, and ethocentrically assumed that it is the rest of humankind, in its failure to embrace freedom, that needs explaining.**

As we will see in <u>the next post</u>, this attitude is quite prevalent in histories of non-western cultures.

When we think of freedom today, we think of an existentialist, universal humanity-affirming idea and value. Assata Shakur, a Black Panther who escaped life sentence in prison in 1979 and found asylum in Cuba, gives us a powerful articulation of this (from [A Song For Assata - Common](https://youtu.be/HaqXrT9bU10)):

> Freedom! You askin' me about freedom. Asking me about freedom? I'll be honest with you **I know a whole lot more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, cause I've never been free.** I can only share my vision with you of the future about what freedom is. The way I see it, **freedom is the right to grow, is the right to blossom.** Freedom is the right to be yourself, to be who you are, to be who you want to be, to do what you want to do.

Thus far, we have understood freedom as a particular sociopolitical concept that emerged uniquely in ancient Greece in dialectical relation with the emergence of slavery. However, this is clearly distinct from the multitude of meanings it holds for us today. Patterson offers a systematic genealogy tracing its history in the West up to modern day, something worth exploring later, but the colonial and ethnocentric implications of the uniqueness claim are exacerbated when non-western societies and values related to freedom are not studied directly. 

Did non-western societies value the right to grow? Did they value health, wellbeing, the ability to do work of one's choice or the ability to freely express oneself, artistically or otherwise? Did the absence of freedom as a value entail the absence of the capacity to revolt? Did their cultural values require the specter of social death as does freedom? What role did cultural exchange play in the emergence and spread of these distinct but related values? How did these cultures deal with the colonialist and imperialist globalization of western concepts? What does it mean that the globally dominant concept of freedom is apparently rooted in and requires a generalized condition of slavery? Patterson ends with a question that strikes at the very heart of the matter and sharply focuses the stakes of the analysis:

> **Does our concept of personal freedom enslave us to the perpetual re-invention of symbolic substitutes for the social death that was once slavery?** 

<!--So strong is our commitment to this value [freedom], however, and so insistent' our claim that this commitment is natural, that **we have assumed that something is wrong with the rest of the world and with the majority of human history during which no one ever thought it necessary to express and cherish freedom as an ideal**. Our political scientists, oblivious to the way we have inverted history and social reality, repeatedly write learned treatises explaining why the rest of the world and history have not embraced freedom.--> 
<!--As a result of the inverted parochialism of our civilization, **we have posed the problem the wrong way around**. Like Aristophanes' frogs we have not only assumed that it is natural for all creatures to croak, but are puzzled when others are not gladdened by our sound. In fact, **it is not the rest of the world that needs explaining for its lack of commitment to freedom,** and all works of social science and history that attempt to do so are hopelessly misguided; **rather it is the West that must be scrutinized and explained for its peculiar commitment to this value.**-->

<!--[Many] Abolitionists cared little for the Blacks; were in fact complete racists. Why did they become so intensely involved in this extraordinary movement? The answer, clearly, is that it solved one of the major problems of the liberal version of personal freedom, what may be called the crisis of content. **'The absence of impediment' is simply not enough as a doctrine of freedom. It requires some endangering force, some image of social death which is being negated. Only then does it come alive**, does it become liberation and in so doing generate life as its reward . . . The Abolitionist movement was for these people not really primarily intended for the Blacks whose freedom was simply a happy by-product of something more important. It was their own freedom which the Abolitionists were experiencing by their actions. The Abolitionists, at any rate the secular among them, did not discover liberal personal freedom first, and then, on principle, feel an urgent moral obligation to abolish slavery. Rather, **it was in order to give content to the liberal conception of personal freedom, to discover and experience this freedom that, in a vicarious identification with the real thing, they re-enacted the sense of rebirth that the negation of slavery brings.**-->

- A discussion of women's lives in ancient Greece is conspicuously absent in Finley's works, something that is remarkably important considering that even today the domestic slavery of women through the institution of marriage remains prevalent. Patterson improves upon previous scholars' analysis to discuss the "wholly unanticipated discovery that **women played a decisive role in the Western social invention of *personal* freedom**."

  - Read: "Slavery, Alienation, and the Female Discovery of Personal Freedom" - Orlando Patterson, <u>1991</u>, *Social Research*
  - Read: Ch 14. "Marriage, sale and gift in the Homeric world" from "Economy and Society in Ancient Greece"- M.I. Finley

- Finley mentions that even the bedrock institutions of family and private property were attacked at some point by Greek intellectuals. What was this attack and what can Marxists learn from it? A comparison of Finley's analyses with Engels' seems highly warranted.
  
  - Read: "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" - Friedrich Engels, <u>1884</u>
  
- In *The freedom of the citizen in the Greek world*, Finley raises the interesting question of why religious justifications were absent in upholding the ancient Greek state institutions. What sociopolitical role did religion play in ancient Greece?

- In *Was Greek civilisation based on slave labour?*, Finley notes that the Greek language had neither a word to "express the general notion of labour, nor the concept of labour 'as a general social function'." What was the Greek concept of labor, and why did no "ideology of labor" emerge?

  - Read: Part 4 "Work and Technological Thought" from "Myth and Thought Among the Greeks" - Jean-Pierre Vernant, <u>1983</u>

- In the same text, Finley complains about Marxist theory on slavery being stuck in a one-dimensional discussion (whether slavery is *a* basic institution or *the* basic institution). His later texts apparently advanced this debate.

  - Look through: "Ancient Slavery and Modern Ideology" - M.I. Finley, <u>1980</u>

- In a [podcast interview](https://youtu.be/2zl7nLBE7H0), Orlando Patterson discusses his experience growing up in Jamaica during decolonization and having to celebrate 'Empire Day' where children would sing "[Rule, Britannia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule,_Britannia!)" The main chorus quite aptly illustrates the dialectic of freedom and domination in the colonizer's mind:

  > Rule, Britannia! rule the waves: <br>
  > Britons never will be slaves.

- The image I used of slaves working in Laurion mines is from a [random website](https://greekreporter.com/2021/06/18/slavery-ancient-greece/) which does not specify where the art comes from. What was the cultural and artistic representation of slavery in ancient Greece?

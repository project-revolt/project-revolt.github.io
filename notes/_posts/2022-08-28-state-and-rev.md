- Consider the following statements by Lenin:	

  “*The proletariat needs the state — this is repeated by all the opportunists, social-chauvinists and Kautskyites, who assure us that this is what Marx taught. But they “forget” to add that, in the first place, according to Marx, the proletariat needs only a state which is withering away…*”

  “.... *it has been deliberately ignored, for it is absolutely irreconcilable with reformism, and is a slap in the face for the common opportunist prejudices and philistine illusions about the "peaceful development of democracy".*”

  “*The petty-bourgeois democrats, those sham socialists who replaced the class struggle by dreams of class harmony, even pictured the socialist transformation in a dreamy fashion — not as the overthrow of the rule of the exploiting class, but as the peaceful submission of the minority to the majority which has become aware of its aims.*”

  What is Lenin’s essential critique of these “reformists” and “petty bourgeois Democrats” in the USSR?

He’s basically calling them liberals that want to simply reduce exploitation and resolve class struggle through some kind of peaceful class harmony. They want to introduce legal reforms through the existing system and with the permission of the existing State machine, instead of fundamentally changing the material relations of the proletariat by overthrowing the ruling class.

- Consider the following passage: 

  “*The overthrow of bourgeois rule can be accomplished only by the proletariat, the particular class whose economic conditions of existence prepare it for this task and provide it with the possibility and the power to perform it. While the bourgeoisie break up and disintegrate the peasantry and all the petty-bourgeois groups, they weld together, unite and organize the proletariat. Only the proletariat — by virtue of the economic role it plays in large-scale production — is capable of being the leader of all the working and exploited people, whom the bourgeoisie exploit, oppress and crush, often not less but more than they do the proletarians, but who are incapable of waging an independent struggle for their emancipation.*”

  Lenin draws a contrast between the proletariat and “all the working and exploited people” -- what distinction is he making here?

The proletariat are the revolutionarily viable and class conscious section of the working class. The petty bourgeois are still exploited laborers, but less exploited and typically not class conscious. The lumpenproletariat, criminal vagabond section is also not class conscious and can be easily swayed by the bourgeoisie. In general there are heavily exploited laborers and peasants that have not been radicalized, side with the bourgeoisie, etc. It is the job of the class conscious proletariat to educate, radicalize and organize these people.

- In what way do their “economic conditions of existence” prepare the proletariat to overthrow the bourgeois rule?

The proletariat are exploited laborers who are directly engaged to some degree with the bourgeoisie, as the latter owns the labor of the proletariat, subordinates them and extracts surplus value from them. As a result, the proletariat learns from its lived experience with these exploitative social relations that the material conditions perpetuated by a capitalistic mode of production are inherently antagonistic and unjust. The petty bourgeoisie benefit to some extent from these material conditions, and they do not directly experience the same kind of profound exploitation that the proletariat does. The exploitation experienced by the petty bourgeoisie is obfuscated, veiled by their beneficent status within the hegemonic structure of class society. The lumpenproletariat, although heavily exploited and harmed by their position in capitalist society, usually do not have as much direct engagement with the bourgeoisie. They are not wage laborers in the usual sense. These prostitutes, beggars, and criminals do not directly experience the antagonisms that lead to radicalization.

- What is the “economic role” of the proletariat and how does it allow them to lead the working and exploited people?

Those members of the working class that toil in factories, utilize machines and engage in large-scale mass productive activities are more directly able to seize these means of production for the working class. These are the typical economic conditions of the proletariat. Thus, the proletarians, who often work in this industrial capacity, find themselves in a position to lead the working class through their augmented ability to actively expropriate their oppressors. 

- Commenting on Marx’s conclusions from the revolution of 1848-51, Lenin says that,

   “*In the above quoted passage, the question [of the state] is treated in a concrete manner, and the conclusion is extremely precise, definite, practical and palpable: all previous revolutions perfected the state machine, whereas it must be broken, smashed.*”

   In what way did the bourgeois revolutions of 1848-51 “perfect” the state machine?

The revolutions of 1848-51 in France were bourgeois revolutions because, while they overthrew the existing ruling class and changed the material conditions of the working class in impressive ways, did not fully liberate the working class from the antagonisms of class society, did not relinquish them from their oppressed state, did not do away with exploitative social relations; i.e., did not smash the bourgeois state machine. The working class was able to implement some type of parliamentary democracy but the French monarchy still retained its position of power. In this way they merely “improved” or “perfected” the bourgeois state machine. Indeed, the state is more robust and stable with democratic controls. 

- Consider the following quote from Marx: 

   “*And now as to myself, no credit is due to me for discovering the existence of classes in modern society or the struggle between them. Long before me bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists, the economic anatomy of classes. What I did that was new was to prove: (1) that the existence of classes is only bound up with the particular, historical phases in the development of production, (2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat, (3) that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society.*”

   Why does Marx say that class struggle necessarily/inevitably leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat?

Consider Marcuse's thoughts on the matter of 'historical necessity', from *One-Dimensional Man*:

"*I suggest the phrase 'determinate choice' in order to emphasize the ingression of liberty into historical necessity; the phrase does no more than condense the proposition that men make their own history but make it under given conditions. Determined are (1) the specific contradictions which develop within a historical system as manifestations of the conflict between the potential and the actual; (2) the material and intellectual resources available to the respective system; (3) the extent of theoretical and practical freedom compatible with the system. These conditions leave open alternative possibilities of developing and utilizing the available resources, alternative possibilities of 'making a living,' of organizing man's struggle with nature.*"

### <span style="color:#f05454">Chapter III: Experience of the Paris Commune of 1871</span><a name="second"></a>

- Throughout this chapter, Lenin expresses a deep admiration for Marx and a concurrent disgust for what he sees as deliberately malicious distortions of Marx’s views (Kautsky, Bernstein, Social-Democrats, etc). In what ways does Lenin see Marx as a rigorous scientist whose theories are shaped explicitly by data? What aspects of Marx’s views on the state are distorted by the “opportunists”?

I think Lenin views Marx as faithfully exercising a scientific usage of dialectical and historical materialism. Marx bases all of his conclusions about the world from a rigorous analysis of existing material conditions and social relations. Lenin knows that Marx is not interested in laying out a specific plan for building socialism because such a pursuit would be ahistorical, unscientific and pointless. Lenin and Marx are both aware that socialism must be adapted to existing material conditions. This is evidenced by his core belief that the working class of feudal Russia should actively engage in revolutionary struggle and seek to build a dictatorship of the proletariat (according to their own means to do so), despite the fact that there was not an advanced industrial capitalist mode of production. This assessment is supported by the following quotes from Chapter III:

*“Marx did not indulge in utopias; he expected the **experience** of the mass movement to provide the reply to the question as to the specific forms this organisation of the proletariat as the ruling class would assume and as to the exact manner in which this organisation would be combined with the most complete, most consistent '"'winning of the battle of democracy.'"*

*“For Marx, however, revolutionary dialectics was never the empty fashionable phrase, the toy rattle, which Plekhanov, Kautsky and others have made of it. Marx knew how to break with anarchism ruthlessly for its inability to make use even of the 'pigsty' of bourgeois parliamentarism, especially when the situation was obviously not revolutionary; but at the same time he knew how to subject parliamentarism to genuinely revolutionary proletarian criticism.”*

As for the question about opportunists misreading Marx, Lenin devotes an entire chapter to this subject (Ch. VI), so we will see more of this later. The most obvious example of opportunist distortion comes at the beginning of Ch. III, in which Lenin explains the distortion of Marx’s quote in the communist manifesto: “... One thing was especially proved by the Commune, viz., that ‘the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes’...” The opportunists have misinterpreted this quotation to claim that Marx emphasizes “the idea of slow development in contradistinction to the seizure of power,” i.e., to legal reform of the state as opposed to seizing the state. In fact, Lenin explains that “Marx’s idea is that the working class must break up, smash the “ready-made state machinery”, and not confine itself to merely laying hold of it.

Another example of opportunist distortion is discussed by Kautsky himself, who said, regarding the programme of the Austrian Social-Democratic party: “Many of our revisionist critics believe that Marx asserted that economic development and the class struggle create, not only the conditions for socialist production, but also, and directly, the *consciousness* of its necessity.” Kautsky criticizes the party’s belief that “socialist consciousness appears to be a necessary and direct result of the proletarian class struggle.” Indeed, he says, 

*"... this is absolutely untrue. Of course, socialism, as a doctrine, has its roots in modern economic relationships just as the class struggle of the proletariat has, and, like the latter, emerges from the struggle against the capitalist-created poverty and misery of the masses. But socialism and the class struggle arise side by side and not one out of the other; each arises under different conditions."*

*"Modern socialist consciousness can arise only on the basis of profound scientific knowledge. Indeed, modern economic science is as much a condition for socialist production as, say, modern technology, and the proletariat can create neither the one nor the other, no matter how much it may desire to do so; both arise out of the modern social process."*

*"The vehicle of science is not the proletariat, but the **bourgeois intelligentsia**: it was in the minds of individual members of this stratum that modern socialism originated, and it was they who communicated it to the more intellectually developed proletarians who, in their turn, introduce it into the proletarian class struggle where conditions allow that to be done. Thus, socialist consciousness is something introduced into the proletarian class struggle from without and not something that arose within it spontaneously.”*

- Do you think Lenin’s conclusion about America in this paragraph still holds true today?

  *"Today, in 1917, at the time of the first great imperialist war, this restriction made by Marx is no longer valid. Both Britain and America, the biggest and the last representatives — in the whole world — of Anglo-Saxon 'liberty', in the sense that they had no militarist cliques and bureaucracy, have completely sunk into the all-European filthy, bloody morass of bureaucratic-military institutions which subordinate everything to themselves, and suppress everything. Today, in Britain and America, too, 'the precondition for every real people's revolution' is the **smashing**, the **destruction** of the 'ready-made state machinery' (made and brought up to the 'European', general imperialist, perfection in those countries in the years 1914-17).”*

- Consider the following paragraph,

   *"If we take the revolutions of the 20th century as examples we shall, of course, have to admit that the Portuguese and the Turkish revolutions are both bourgeois revolutions. Neither of them, however, is a ' people's' revolution, since in neither does the mass of the people, their vast majority, come out actively, independently, with their own economic and political demands to any noticeable degree. By contrast, although the Russian bourgeois revolution of 1905-07 displayed no such 'brilliant' successes as at time fell to the Portuguese and Turkish revolutions, it was undoubtedly a 'real people's' revolution, since the mass of the people, their majority, the very lowest social groups, crushed by oppression and exploitation, rose independently and stamped on the entire course of the revolution the imprint of **their** own demands, **their** attempt to build in their own way a new society in place of the old society that was being destroyed."*

   Lenin says that the Russian revolution of 1905-1907 was “bourgeois” but nevertheless also a “real people’s” revolution (in contradistinction with the Portuguese and Turkish revolutions, which were only bourgeois). What is the distinction between these two kinds of revolutions? Why does Lenin say that it was a bourgeois revolution?

Bourgeois revolutions support the interests of the bourgeoisie and petite-bourgeoisie, and not the majority of the people. According to Lenin in the above passage, a necessary condition for a real people’s revolution is that the mass of the people come out with their own independent economic and political demands. He also says that a real people’s revolution must include both the peasants and the proletariat, for they together constitute “the people”. 

The distinction Lenin makes here helps to elucidate the political situation of Russia in the early 20th century. “A "people's" revolution, one actually sweeping the majority into its stream, could be such only if it embraced both the proletariat and the peasants. These two classes then constituted the “people”. These two classes are united by the fact that the "bureaucratic-military state machine" oppresses, crushes, exploits them. To *smash* this machine, *to break it up*, is truly in the interest of the “people”, of their majority, of the workers and most of the peasants, is "the precondition" for a free alliance of the poor peasant and the proletarians, whereas without such an alliance democracy is unstable and socialist transformation is impossible.”

This elucidates Lenin’s position in relation to the Mensheviks, Social-Democrats, etc., as Lenin sought to bring the peasant population of Russia (which made up a very large proportion of the population of Russia) into the revolution, to utilize them as a revolutionary tool. This is in direct contrast with the platform of the Mensheviks, who did not support a nationalization of the land and instead “advocated for a so-called municipalization, i.e. control of the land by local elected authorities, which in rural areas would be peasant authorities.” Moreover, “They saw many dangers and little socialism in the kind of elemental peasant risings to which Lenin appeared to be pinning his hopes.” Thus, Lenin would label the Mensheviks’ proposed revolution a “bourgeois revolution” and not a “real-people’s revolution”.

Now we address the question of why Lenin called the Russian revolution of 1905-1907 bourgeois despite also being a people’s revolution. According to the evolutionary aspects of Marxist theory, socialism naturally grows out of an advanced industrialized capitalist mode of production through the direct action of a class-conscious proletarian force. “If socialism was to grow out of advanced capitalism, then evidently Russia was not and would not for a long time be ripe for socialism. The Tsarist regime was a pre-capitalist and semi-feudal system of oppression. The situation was ripe for a bourgeois-democratic revolution designed to overthrow Tsarism.” The wide variety of responses to this problem in the Russian political world gave rise to the myriad of “socialist” political parties at the time. Upon the overthrow of Tsarism, the Mensheviks saw themselves as the social democratic opposition in a bourgeois-democratic republic. They believed that social change would in due course create the conditions for socialism, and that this process would involve industrialization under capitalist auspices. They did not think a genuine socialist revolution was viable in Russia given its current material conditions. 

Lenin and his party, the Bolsheviks, were in emphatic disagreement with the Mensheviks on this issue. Lenin saw more clearly the revolutionary potential of the peasants, and came to see the possibilities of a seizure of power on the basis of a peasant as well as a working-class revolution, in a country unripe for socialism, yet with a weak and 'cowardly' bourgeoisie. He spoke in 1905 of 'the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry'. It was far from clear what this would mean in terms of practical politics, and at this period Lenin was under no compulsion to demonstrate the practicability of his ideas. However, it did show that he was going beyond the Menshevik conception of a bourgeois-democratic republic in which the capitalists would presumably supply the government parties.

Lenin thus developed the concept of a seizure of power by a conscious socialist minority with the help of non-socialist elements in a country where capitalism was unevenly developed. It was wrong in this view to await the ripening of the social and economic situation; this change would therefore have to be achieved after the seizure of power. Lenin understood that such a transformation after a successful revolution would be an exceedingly difficult one. However, he hoped that Russia would prove to be the weak link in the unevenly developing group of imperialist states, that a revolution in Russia would be the first stage of a world revolution, and that the more advanced countries of Western Europe would help in the colossal task of the building of socialism. This was along the lines of Trotsky’s theory of “permanent revolution,” in which a revolution originally bourgeois-democratic is pushed irresistibly in a socialist direction by a working class unwilling to be satisfied with bourgeois rule.

Lenin called the 1905-07 (The First Russian Revolution) bourgeois because it was merely preliminary. Upon its success, the people managed to make democratic reforms to the monarchy. They introduced the October Manifesto in 1905 followed by the Russian constitution of 1906, which established a Russian duma and implemented some democratic policies. However, the tsar still managed to keep his rule and a dictatorship of the proletariat was not established. That is why Lenin calls it a bourgeois revolution.

- Summarize Lenin’s concrete description of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the section "What is to Replace the Smashed State Machine?”

Upon establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, the smashed state machine is replaced by fuller democracy: abolition of the standing army and the substitution for it of the armed people, all officials to be elected and subject to recall, the abolition of all representation allowances and of all monetary privileges to officials, and the reduction of the remuneration of all servants of the state to the level of “workmen’s wages”.

- Consider the following passage:

  *“The reduction of the remuneration of high state officials seem “simply” a demand of naive, primitive democracy. One of the “founders” of modern opportunism, the ex-Social-Democrat Eduard Bernstein, has more than once repeated the vulgar bourgeois jeers at 'primitive' democracy. Like all opportunists, and like the present Kautskyites, he did not understand at all that, first of all, the transition from capitalism to socialism is impossible without a certain 'reversion' to 'primitive' democracy (for how else can the majority, and then the whole population without exception, proceed to discharge state functions?); and that, secondly, "primitive democracy" based on capitalism and capitalist culture is not the same as primitive democracy in prehistoric or precapitalist times. *"

  "*Capitalist culture has created large-scale production, factories, railways, the postal service, telephones, etc., and on this basis the great majority of the functions of the old 'state power' have become so simplified and can be reduced to such exceedingly simple operations of registration, filing, and checking that they can be easily performed by every literate person, can quite easily be performed for ordinary 'workmen's wages, and that these functions can (and must) be stripped of every shadow of privilege, of every semblance of 'official grandeur'.”*

Why does Lenin say, “the transition from capitalism to socialism is impossible without a certain “reversion” to “primitive” democracy”?

- Lenin devotes an entire section “3. Abolition of Parliamentarism” to a critique of “Parliamentarism”. What is the difference between parliamentarism and workers’ democracy?

“Kautsky has not understood at all the difference between bourgeois parliamentarism, which combines democracy (not for the people) with bureaucracy (against the people), and proletarian democracy, which will take immediate steps to cut bureaucracy down to the roots, and which will be able to carry these measures through to the end, to the complete abolition of bureaucracy, to the introduction of complete democracy for the people.”

- Consider the passage: 

   *"Abolishing the bureaucracy at once, everywhere and completely, is out of the question. It is a utopia. But to smash the old bureaucratic machine at once and to begin immediately to construct a new one that will make possible the gradual abolition of all bureaucracy--this is not a utopia, it is the experience of the Commune, the direct and immediate task of the revolutionary proletariat."*

   Why does Lenin say that “Abolishing the bureaucracy at once, everywhere and completely, is out of the question.”?

- Why did the Paris Commune fail?

Lenin discusses this question in section 2, "What is to replace the smashed state machine?" He says,

"*It is still necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and crush their resistance.* *This was particularly necessary for the Commune; and one of the reasons for its defeat was that it did not do this with sufficient determination.* *The organ of suppression, however, is here the majority of the population, and not a minority, as was always the case under slavery, serfdom, and wage slavery. And since the majority of people itself suppresses its oppressors, a 'special force" for suppression is no longer necessary! In this sense, the state begins to wither away. Instead of the special institutions of a privileged minority (privileged officialdom, the chiefs of the standing army), the majority itself can directly fulfil all these functions, and the more the functions of state power are performed by the people as a whole, the less need there is for the existence of this power.*"

"*It is well known that in the autumn of 1870, a few months before the Commune, Marx warned the Paris workers that any attempt to overthrow the government would be the folly of despair. But when, in March 1871, a decisive battle was forced upon the workers and they accepted it, when the uprising had become a fact, Marx greeted the proletarian revolution with the greatest enthusiasm, in spite of unfavorable auguries.*"

### <span style="color:#f05454">Chapter IV: Supplementary Explanations</span><a name="third"></a>

- Lenin notes Engels’ elaboration on the activities of the proletarian state regarding the collection of rent from *The Housing Question*:

   *“there is already a sufficient quantity of houses in the big cities to remedy immediately all real 'housing shortage', provided they are used judiciously. This can naturally only occur through the expropriation of the present owners and by quartering in their houses homeless workers or workers overcrowded in their present homes.”*

   And then Lenin writes,

   *"... Expropriations and billetings take place by order even of the present state. From the formal point of view, the proletarian state will also 'order' the occupation of dwellings and expropriation of houses . . . All this calls for a certain form of state, but it does not at all call for a special military bureaucratic apparatus, with officials occupying especially privileged positions. The transition to a situation in which it will be possible to supply dwellings rent-­free depends on the complete 'withering away' of the state."*

   Why does a proletarian state not preclude the existence of the rent-relation, and why does the disappearance of the rent-relation depend on the withering away of the state?

Engels is elaborating on the economic aspects of the transitionary state, i.e. the dictatorship of the proletariat. During this phase of society, the existence of state property has not been abolished but rather put into the hands of the working class to own collectively (because they constitute the state, after all). Hence, rent paid on a property has not been abolished but rather goes into the hands of the democratically and collectively led government. Instead of rent going into the pocket of a private capitalist or landlord for his personal benefit, the rent goes to the government for redistribution/reinvestment towards the common good. Rent-relations can only be fully abolished when state property has been abolished, i.e., with the withering away of the state.

- Lenin re-presents Marx and Engels’ remarkable critique of anarchists and so-called “anti-authoritarians”:

   *"Having thus shown that authority and autonomy are relative terms, that the sphere of their application varies with the various phases of social development, that it is absurd to take them as absolutes, and adding that the sphere of application of machinery and large­-scale production is steadily expanding, Engels passes from the general discussion of authority to the question of the state."*

   *“Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is an act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon, all of which are highly authoritarian means. And the victorious party must maintain its rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionaries. Would the Paris Commune have lasted more than a day if it had not used the authority of the armed people against the bourgeoisie? Cannot we, on the contrary, blame it for having made too little use of that authority?"*

   Is a revolution necessarily authoritarian? Is a slave revolt authoritarian?

One might say that an authoritarian system is created by an institutional exertion of control of one social group over another, in such a way as to establish a hierarchical imbalance. The capitalist mode of production is one example. We might therefore say that a proletarian revolution or a slave rebellion is actually anti-authoritarian because it revolts against such an authoritarian system. Authoritarianism is not simply enforcing your will on another, but rather using a system to institute and reinforce a political hierarchy -- a rebellion does the opposite by using whatever social power the oppressed groups have to destroy institutions that reinforce political hierarchy.

Proletarians or slaves, during an initial uprising or rebellion, do not wield an institution of power against the bourgeoisie -- they have their fists, their guns, their physical tools -- and they use these to seize control of the means of production or political institutions and assert themselves over the authoritarian ruling class. They do not yet possess any "authority" to assert over the capitalist class. In this sense, the revolution is not authoritarian, in fact it is anti-authoritarian. 

However, we might consider that the "revolution" is not merely the act of expropriating your oppressor, it is not merely the act of seizing the oppressive political institution in an initial uprising. The revolution must also entail the continual re-assertion of the power of the proletariat and the maintenance of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The revolution is ongoing, it is a "permanent revolution" in the Trotskyist language. In this sense, the revolution must certainly be authoritarian.

- According to Lenin, what is Engels' critique of the terms "free state" and "people's state"?

According to Engels' critique, the term “free state” is nonsensical because it emphasizes the freedom of the state in comparison to the relative unfreedom of the people, whereas it is the people that are free under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and not the state. The term “free people’s state” is also a poor choice because the transitionary state of the dictatorship of the proletariat is, in Engels’ view, no longer a state proper, as it is not the same kind of state that capitalists wield and anarchists decry. Moreover, the phrases “free people” and “state” are in direct contradiction with one another, because insofar as the people are free they do not need the state, and so long as the people need the state, it is not needed in the interests of freedom.

- According to Lenin in the following passage, in what ways is a “democratic republic” preferable to a monarchy or despotic government for the proletariat?

   *"Two more remarks. 1. Engels' statement that in a democratic republic, "no less" than in a monarchy, the state remains a "machine for the oppression of one class by another" by no means signifies that the form of oppression makes no difference to the proletariat, as some anarchists “teach”. A wider, freer and more open form of the class struggle and of class oppression vastly assists the proletariat in its struggle for the abolition of classes in general."*

- What is the distinction between a federal republic and a democratic centralized republic?

- How does Lenin think his opponents misinterpret the formula “religion is a private matter”? 

- What does Lenin mean by “the withering away of the state means the withering away of democracy” in the following paragraph?

   *"In the usual argument about the state, the mistake is constantly made against which Engels warned and which we have in passing indicated above, namely, it is constantly forgotten that the abolition of the state means also the abolition of democracy; that the withering away of the state means the withering away of democracy."*

Lenin explains this admittedly strange idea by appealing to the vastly different social conditions of a fully communist society, which exists after the state has withered away: 

*"In striving for socialism, however, we are convinced that it will develop into communism and, therefore, that the need for violence against people in general, for the subordination of one man to another, and of one section of the population to another, will vanish altogether since people will become accustomed to observing the elementary conditions of social life without violence and without subordination."*

In light of this explanation, however, we are led to wonder: what does democracy look like in a stateless communist society?

------

### <span style="color:#f05454">Chapter V:  The Economic Basis of the Withering Away of the State</span><a name="fourth"></a>

- Lenin contrasts two ways of phrasing the question of how capitalism transitions into communism: 

   *"Previously the question was put as follows: to achieve its emancipation, the proletariat must overthrow the bourgeoisie, win political power and establish its revolutionary dictatorship."*

   *"Now the question is put somewhat differently: the transition from capitalist society--which is developing towards communism--to communist society is impossible without a 'political transition period', and the state in this period can only be the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat."*

What is the difference between these two ways of phrasing the question at hand?

- Considering the following paragraph,

   *"... the suppression of the minority of exploiters by the majority of the wage slaves of yesterday is comparatively so easy, simple and natural a task that it will entail far less bloodshed than the suppression of the risings of slaves, serfs or wage-laborers, and it will cost mankind far less … Naturally, the exploiters are unable to suppress the people without a highly complex machine for performing this task, but the people can suppress the exploiters even with a very simple 'machine', almost without a 'machine', without a special apparatus, by the simple organization of the armed people (such as the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, we would remark, running ahead)."*

   In what ways would the state apparatus used to suppress the capitalist class be simpler than that which is used to suppress the proletariat?

- Consider the following excerpt:

   *"Marx not only most scrupulously takes account of the inevitable inequality of men, but he also takes into account the fact that the mere conversion of the means of production into the common property of the whole society (commonly called 'socialism') does not remove the defects of distribution and the inequality of 'bourgeois laws' which continues to prevail so long as products are divided 'according to the amount of labor performed'."*

   What kinds of “defects of distribution” does Lenin think are inherited from capitalism? What are the “bourgeois laws” that persist during socialism?

From the previous paragraph, Lenin describes “... the other injustice, which consists in the distribution of consumer goods "according to the amount of labor performed" (and not according to needs).” So perhaps one main defect of distribution is that goods are not distributed according to need but according to labor performed? But why are these two things mutually exclusive?

In the lower phase of communism, goods are distributed according to labor and not according to need. This is the defect. Society has not yet achieved the principle of “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” which embodies the higher phase of communism.

As for the notion of bourgeois law, Lenin draws this directly from Marx. They seems to use the term “bourgeois law” as a catch-all for the way capitalist ideology and bourgeois interests inform our organization of the production process, resource allocation, social norms, etc.

Lenin elaborates on this point later on: “In its first phase, or first stage, communism cannot as yet be fully mature economically and entirely free from traditions or vestiges of capitalism. Hence the interesting phenomenon that communism in its first phase retains "the narrow horizon of bourgeois law". Of course, bourgeois law in regard to the distribution of consumer goods inevitably presupposes the existence of the bourgeois state, for law is nothing without an apparatus capable of enforcing the observance of the rules of law.” - the key words here seem to be “traditions or vestiges,” so we mean that there are remnants of capitalist ideology or work ethics or social norms or economic modalities that persist and inform the socialist model in specific (usually negative) ways which Lenin describes.

- Explain the apparent contradiction (?) in the following section:

   *"… the other socialist principle, 'An equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor', is also already realized [in lower-phase communism]. But this is not yet communism, and it does not yet abolish 'bourgeois law', which gives unequal individuals, in return for unequal (really unequal) amounts of labor, equal amounts of products."*

   Lenin seems to say that in socialism (the lower-phase of communism), workers receive equal products for equal labor, but then says socialism has not yet abolished “bourgeois law” by which workers receive equal products for unequal labor. What does it mean to say that bourgeois law allocates equal resources for unequal labor?

- Consider the following quote from Lenin’s essay *Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat*: 

   *"Socialism means the abolition of classes. The dictatorship of the proletariat has done all it could to abolish classes. But classes cannot be abolished at one stroke."*

   Furthermore, consider Lenin’s statement on the withering away of the state from *The State and Revolution*:

   *"The state withers away insofar as there are no longer any capitalists, any classes, and, consequently, no class can be suppressed."*

   Combining these two statements, we can only conclude that Lenin believed socialism to be a stateless mode of production (since socialism means the abolition of classes, and the state withers away when classes cease to exist). In fact, Jonas Čeika derives this exact conclusion in his video *Marx was not a statist* (see timestamp 11:37, where the aspect "No states" is listed under LPC = socialism). 

   However, this conclusion directly contradicts Lenin’s description of socialism (the lower phase of communism) in *The State and Revolution*:

   *"...Now, there are no other rules than those of "bourgeois law". To this extent, therefore, there still remains the need for a state, which, while safeguarding the common ownership of the means of production, would safeguard equality in labor and in the distribution of products … But the state has not yet completely withered away, since there still remains the safeguarding of "bourgeois law", which sanctifies actual inequality. **For the state to wither away completely, complete communism is necessary.**"*

Here is an attempt to resolve this problem. Lenin believes the lower phase of communism **is not stateless**, he is pretty clear about that in this chapter, but that **it is classless**. So the problem lies in our conclusion that, because it is classless, and because the state withers away when classes cease to exist, socialism must necessarily be stateless. Indeed, Lenin merely says that the state **begins** to wither away when classes no longer exist and the perpetuation of class antagonisms (which is the sole purpose of state) ceases to have purpose. The state does not simply cease to exist all at once -- it is a gradual process. We should not be mechanistic or deterministic -- this is anti-dialectical. We cannot indulge in strictly deterministic implications such as "no classes implies no state". When classes are abolished we have socialism, but it is possible that some remaining vestige of the state and its infrastructure still exists, after all, Lenin says later that,

*"In its first phase, or first stage, communism cannot as yet be fully mature economically and entirely free from traditions or vestiges of capitalism. Hence the interesting phenomenon that communism in its first phase retains 'the narrow horizon of bourgeois law'. Of course, bourgeois law in regard to the distribution of consumer goods inevitably presupposes the existence of the bourgeois state, for law is nothing without an apparatus capable of enforcing the observance of the rules of law."*

And furthermore that “in fact, remnants of the old, surviving in the new, confront us in life at every step, both in nature and in society. And Marx did not arbitrarily insert a scrap of “bourgeois” law into communism, but indicated what is economically and politically inevitable in a society emerging out of the womb of capitalism.” -- this is dialectical as fuck. The remnants of the old surviving in the new is an eternal dynamic and dialectical process, thus it is only reasonable that vestiges of the old society and its state would persist in the lower phase of communism.

Just as we cannot name the particular moment at which feudalism transformed into capitalism, we cannot name the particular moment at which socialism transforms into communism, i.e. when the state disappears. Therefore, the lower phase of communism is *exactly* that mode of production which exists in limbo between the abolition of classes and the abolition of the state!

| Capitalism                      | DOTP                        | LPC (socialism)                   | HPC (communism)   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| State controlled by capitalists | State controlled by workers | State in the process of withering | State abolished   |
| Markets                         | Markets                     | No markets                        | No markets        |
| Capitalist class in power       | Working class in power      | Classes abolished                 | Classes abolished |

I think more can be said about the "markets question" -- whether socialism can utilize markets or a mixture of central planning and markets effectively -- especially in light of the rise of China in the 21st century and Xi Jinping's interpretation of "Socialism with Chinese characteristics". But for simplicity we have deferred to the basic Leninist conception in which socialism primarily utilizes central planning and market systems are largely abolished.

- In his book *One-Dimensional Man*, Marcuse discusses his interpretation of the Soviet Marxist perspective that Lenin elucidates in this chapter; namely, that socialism must spring from an advanced industrial apparatus controlled by a dictatorship of the proletariat.

   *"Indeed, society must first create the material prerequisites of freedom for all its members before it can be a free society; it must first create the wealth before being able to distribute it according to the freely developing needs of the individual; it must first enable its slaves to learn and see and think before they know what is going on and what they themselves can do to change it. And, to the degree to which the slaves have been preconditioned to exist as slaves and be content in that role, their liberation necessarily appears to come from without and from above. They must be 'forced to be free.' to 'see objects as they are, and sometimes as they ought to appear.' they must be shown the 'good road' they are in search of."*

   However, Marcuse offers the following counterargument:

   *"But with all its truth, the argument cannot answer the time-honored question: who educates the educators, and where is the proof that they are in possession of 'the good?' The question is not invalidated by arguing that it is equally applicable to certain democratic forms of government where the fateful decisions on what is good for the nation are made by elected representatives (or rather endorsed by elected representatives – elected under conditions of effective and freely accepted indoctrination). Still, the only possible excuse (it is weak enough!) for 'educational dictatorship' is that the terrible risk which it involves may not be more terrible than the risk which the great liberal as well as the authoritarian societies are taking now, nor may the costs be much higher."*

   What steps could socialist revolutionaries take to address the problems emerging from the question of “who educates the educators”? That is, what checks and balances could be put in place to ensure that the proletariat remains on the “good road”?

------

We conclude by making note of a few more interesting quotes from Marcuse's *One-Dimensional Man*, that we found relevant to several topics of discussion covered in *The State and Revolution*:

*"True, there is a 'first phase' of socialist construction during which the new society is 'still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges,' as but the qualitative change from the old to the new society occurred when this phase began. According to Marx, the 'second phase' is literally constituted in the first phase. The qualitatively new mode of life generated by the new mode of production appears in the socialist revolution, which is the end and at the end of the capitalist system. Socialist construction begins with the first phase of the revolution."*

*"By the same token, the transition from 'to each according to his work' to 'to each according to his needs' is determined by the first phase – not only by the creation of the technological and material base, but also (and this is decisive!) by the mode in which it is created. Control of the productive process by the 'immediate producers' is supposed to initiate the development which distinguishes the history of free men from the prehistory of man. This is a Society in which the former objects of productivity first become the human individuals who plan and use the instruments of their labor for the realization of their own humane needs and faculties."*

*"For the first time in history, men would act freely and collectively under and against the necessity which limits their freedom and their humanity. Therefore all repression imposed by necessity would be truly self-imposed necessity. In contrast to this conception, the actual development in present-day communist society postpones (or is compelled to postpone, by the international situation) the qualitative change to the second phase, and the transition from capitalism to socialism appears, in spite of the revolution, still as quantitative change. The enslavement of man by the instruments of his labor continues in a highly rationalized and vastly efficient and promising form."*
